  Only load a leaf when double-clicked.
    If its a path then load the directory, otherwise the file.


  Storage:
      1.
      Creatures->Items->Interface->World->Illidan->Wolf->Spider->Expansion1->...
      But this would have the memory fragmented.
      
      2. Preferably, but would be more messy.
      Creatures->Illidan->Wolf->Spider->Items->Interface->World->Expansion1

      Since the code will loop through it recursively.
      But will also leave the memory fragmented.

      3. Same as 2 but shift memory around as you load it in.
